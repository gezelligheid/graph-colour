-- Functions needed for p2 games --


all game modes

	/**
	* function to display all the edges of the graph, coloured correctly, must check whether the current colouration is legal
	* @param 
	* @return
	*/
	
	/**
	* function to display all the vertices of the graph, coloured according to the player
	* @param Vertex[] V - a list of all vertices, with V.x and V.y as its coordinates and V.colour[3] its rgb colour. See the end of the file Drawing.java for the full Vertex class.
	* @return

	/**
	* function to display the selection box, and which colour is currently selected
	* @param
	* @return

	/**
	* function to check whether the player has clicked on a vertex or a colour in the selection box

1st two game modes: bitter end, best upper bound

{
	
	/**
	* timer that ends the game
	* @param
	* @return
	*/
	
	/**
	* hint function for when you can choose which node to colour next
	* @param
	* @return
	*/
}

3rd game mode: random order

{

	/**
	* function to choose an order in the graph
	* @param
	* @return
	*/
	
	/**
	* hint function for when you're forced to colour a node
	* @param
	* @return

}
